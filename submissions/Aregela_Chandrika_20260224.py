Write  a  program  to  determine  sum , difference , product , quotient , largest  and  smallest  of  two  numbers.
Also  find  remainder,  sqrt  of  first  input , power, gcd  and  factorial  of  first  input

Hint:  Use  F  string  to  print  results

Let  inputs  be  10  and  7,
What  is  the  sum ?  --->  17 
What  is  the  difference ?  --->  3
What  is  the  product ?  --->  70
What  is  the  quotient ?  --->  1.42
What  is  the  remainder ?  ---> 3
What  is  the  largest  number ?  --->  10
What  is  the  smallest  number ?  --->  7
What  is  the  sqrt  of  1st  input ?  --->  3.16
What  is  the  result  of  power ?  --->  10000000
What  is  the  gcd  of  2  numbers ?  --->  1
What  is  the  factorial   of  1st  input ?  --->  10!
