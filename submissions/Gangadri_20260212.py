e = 9.62e-2
print(e) => The output is 0.0962
print(9.8.2) => this will through the syntax error.


2. # complex object demo program
a = 3 + 4j

print(a.real) => The outptut is 0.0
print(a.imag) = > The output is 6.0
print(5 + j6) => The outptut is : syntax error : ( j must comes the after number).
print(3 + 4i) => The outptut is : invalid error because python uses ‘j’ not ‘I’
print(4+j) => The output is error. Because ‘j’ is not defined.
print(4 + 1j) => The output is : (4+ 1j)
print(4 + 0j) => The output is (4 + 0j)


4. # bool object demo program (Home work)
a = True

b = False
print(b) => The output is : False.
print(type(b)) => The ouput is <class ‘bool’>
print(True + True) =>The output is :2 because the in bool values (True = 1 + True = 1 ;
1+1=2.
print(True + False) =>The output is : 1 (True = 1 , False = 0).
print(False + True) => The output is : 1 (False = 0, True = 1).
print(False + False) => The output is : 0 (False = 0, False = 0; 0+0 = 0).
print(True + True + True) =>The output is : 3 (True + True + True; 1+1+1 = 3).
print(25 + 10.8 + True) => The output is 36.8 (25 + 10.8 + True ) (25 + 36.8 +1 = 36.8).
print(True > False) => The output is True. (True = 1 , False = 0 ; 1 > 0 = True)
print(True) => The output is True.
print(False) => The output is False.
print(true) => The output is ‘true is not defined’ (in bool condition used in the capital
letter ‘T’). (True).

letter ‘F’). (False).


5. # Find outputs (Home work)
a = 0O6247 =>Allowed digits: 0 to 7 only
print(a) => The output is 3239
print(type(a)) => The output is <class ‘int’>
print(id(a)) => it will gives the memory location of the reference.
b = 0o6247
print(id(b)) => it will occupies the same memory allocation because (in python int is reusable component).
print(b) > The output is 3239.
c = 3239
print(c) => The output is 3239.
print(id(c)) => it indicates the some memory allocation.
print(0o9248) => The output is ‘invalid’ because (in octal number allowed only ‘0 to 7)
(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) 8 and 9 are not allowed.

print(b)
print(A7B9) => The output is not defined
print('A7B9') => This indicates a string . output is : A7B9
print(0XBEER) => The output is not valid . because in hexadecimal letters will allowed
only A to f) R is not allowed
print(0XHYD) => Here also same ‘ H ‘ is not allowed
print(0xA7G9B) => ‘G’ is not allowed in a hexadecimal.
